**CPP_CellularAutomata_pt2_FlowingCircuitry**
-----------------------
Another File Dump Of OpenGL renderer. Cleaned up some things as well as did some changes in this one. Interesting patterns were seeming to arise from messing with the sine weight of life or death. This helped me a lot get a feeling for cosine's usage in all this as well for less bloaty expansions.
